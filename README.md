Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques

1.Aim and Objective Definition
Application: Define the specific application, such as an AI-powered chatbot, a solar panel energy system, or an 
automation tool for manufacturing.
Purpose: Describe the purpose of the design in the context of the user or operational need, such as customer 
engagement, energy efficiency, or process automation.
Target Audience/User Base: Identify who will interact with or benefit from the application (e.g., customers, 
factory operators, or households). Main Objectives:
• Outline goals like improving efficiency, enhancing user engagement, optimizing energy usage, or 
streamlining operations.

2. Scenario and Use Case Definition
Create detailed scenarios or use cases that define how the application will function in real-world situations. This 
forms the basis for evaluating design choices.
• Prompt Example: "Imagine a scenario where a user interacts with the AI-powered chatbot for 
support. What types of questions might they ask, and what responses would help guide them 
effectively?"
• Response Development: Identify responses that would help guide users, offering information such 
as product recommendations, troubleshooting, or directing users to a human agent if needed.
• Prompt Example for Solar Panel System: "In a residential neighborhood with varying sunlight 
exposure, how should the solar panel system adapt to maximize energy capture?"
• Response Development: Solutions may include dynamic angle adjustment or feedback on optimal 
installation placement based on energy output data.

4. Design Aspects and Prompt Patterns
Idea Generation Prompts
Purpose: Generate innovative features that support application goals, such as efficiency, user engagement, or 
ease of use.
• Example (Chatbot): "What unique features could enhance the chatbot’s ability to resolve common 
inquiries on its own?"
• Ideas: Implementing a knowledge base with conversational shortcuts, user-friendly response 
templates, and integration with FAQ databases.
• Example (Solar Panel System): "What new functionalities could improve solar energy capture, even 
during cloudy days?"
• Ideas: Use bifacial solar panels that capture light from both sides or integrate energy storage 
solutions for consistent power supply.

Persona and Context Prompts

Purpose: Shape the tone, style, and experience of the application to align with user expectations.
• Example (Manufacturing Automation): "What tone should the system’s user interface adopt to 
help operators trust and understand automation tasks?"
• Outcome: Clear, concise messaging with an emphasis on safety notifications, and real-time system 
health updates.
• Example (Chatbot): "How should the chatbot address users with varying levels of technical 
expertise?"
• Outcome: The chatbot could use simplified language for general users and more technical terms if 
interacting with advanced users.

Exploratory Prompts
Purpose: Investigate additional information, constraints, or environmental factors relevant to the design.
• Example (Solar Panel System): "What are the environmental and energy needs of typical residential 
customers in sunny vs. cloudy regions?"
• Result: A customized recommendation for each region, suggesting higher-capacity storage for 
cloudy regions and optimized panel tilt angles in sunny areas.
• Example (Manufacturing): "What technical requirements and constraints must the automation 
system meet in a high-temperature industrial environment?"
• Result: Selection of durable, heat-resistant materials and fail-safe mechanisms to ensure operational 
continuity.

Refinement Prompts
Purpose: Adjust design specifications to meet project standards or user expectations.
• Example (Chatbot): "How can we refine the chatbot’s responses to ensure accuracy and user 
satisfaction?"
• Refinement: Tailor responses based on frequent user feedback to improve relevance, conciseness, 
and tone.
• Example (Solar Panel System): "What materials should be chosen for the system to withstand harsh 
weather conditions while optimizing cost?"
• Refinement: Select corrosion-resistant materials, even if slightly more expensive, to ensure longterm 
durability in extreme weather.

Error Handling Prompts
Purpose: Prepare for potential errors or challenges in the system functionality or user interaction.
• Example (Chatbot): "How should the chatbot respond if it doesn’t understand a user’s question or if 
an error occurs?"
• Fallback Responses: Provide suggestions, apologize for confusion, and offer to redirect to a human 
representative.
• Example (Automation): "How should the automation system handle a power failure during critical 
processes?"
• Error Handling Plan: Implement emergency backup protocols and clear alerts for operators to 
respond immediately.

6. Implementation Plan
Detailed Steps for Building and Implementing the Design
1. System Configuration and Setup: Choose hardware, software, and components tailored to specific 
needs (e.g., NLP models, solar panel specs, or automation machinery).
2. Component Integration: Set up communication channels between different modules (e.g., 
chatbottodatabase, panels-to-battery storage).
3. Prototype Development: Create a functional prototype based on design prompts and scenario testing 
results.
4. Testing and Feedback: Use scenario testing and targeted feedback to refine the system before full 
deployment.
5. Deployment and Integration: Install and integrate with existing systems (e.g., e-commerce platforms, 
power grids, or factory equipment).
5. Evaluation and Feedback Collection
Use targeted feedback prompts to assess user or stakeholder satisfaction and functionality.
• Feedback Prompts: "How intuitive do users find the chatbot’s responses?" "Does the solar panel system 
meet expected energy outputs?" "Is the automation system meeting productivity benchmarks?"
• Feedback Collection: Conduct user surveys, analyze usage data, and gather stakeholder insights to guide 
iterative improvements.

7. Documentation of Findings
Summarize how each prompting technique influenced design choices:
• Idea Generation led to innovative features that aligned with user needs.
• Scenario Testing ensured the design’s adaptability and effectiveness in realistic conditions.
• Error Handling prompted protocols for addressing system breakdowns and user dissatisfaction.
Include any limitations observed during testing, such as environmental constraints or the need for future feature 
expansions.
